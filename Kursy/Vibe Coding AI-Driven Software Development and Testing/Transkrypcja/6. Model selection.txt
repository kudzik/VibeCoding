6. Model selection

Cursor lets you use various models and currently this is all set here to auto.

So right here the agent you're going to see this auto is pretty hidden here.

But if you click on this you're going to see this list here.

So auto simply means auto select meaning that cursor is going to select the best model for you.

Which actually for most people who don't care about the underlying model, that's totally fine.

However, there are differences between those models.

If you know exactly what you want, then maybe you should also select the model that you want to have

there.

Currently, at the time of this recording, cloud 3.7 sonnet, but also Gemini 2.5 Pro are very good

models.

The list will change.

So you're going to see here model is disappearing from the list, new models appearing and so on.

There's one more important thing.

And this is the thinking option here.

So we're going to see here thinking is disabled and thinking refers to reasoning models.

So models who spend a bit more time thinking about the problem, trying out different things in the

background before coming up with a solution.

Now this is super important because on one hand, thinking models do provide better results.

At the same time, a thinking model takes more time.

So if you are a bit impatient, then probably a thinking model is not such a good idea, especially

if you just want to quickly prototype something.

However, if you're noticing that you are working on a more complex problem, and the model that you

have selected is not providing the kind of results that you expect, do consider going for a thinking

model.

I'm going to disable it for now and keep this auto select.

I'm going to see about this later.
